## What are you going to do?

### Step 1:

Have a look ad the Figma file and understand what we want to achieve.

### Step 2:

On the `Card.jsx` component write the code for a card similar to the onse on Figma. For now, focus on showing the right image and not on the logic of flipping the card.

### Step 3:

Using the `cats` state, render two cards using the images from the mock database.

### Step 4:

Since this is a matching game, write the logic to duplicate the cats objects and render four cat cards.

### Step 5:

Write the logic so when you click two cards with the same image the app recognizes it as a match.

### Step 6:

Write the logic so when you click two cards with different images the app doesn't recognize it as a match.

### Extras:

- Get more cats from the website and pick randomly a couple of cats to show.

We have a "database" set up on this file ➡️ `data/db.json`

If you want to use it you need to run the following commands ➡️
`cd data` and `json-server --watch db.json`
